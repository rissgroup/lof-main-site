      <p className="lg:w-11/12 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-lg">Our token is the fundamental currency on our platforms, giving the advantage of anonymity, allowing the users to buy and consume content without identity verification or having to give out credit card details. LOF token also allows them to enjoy extremely competitive prices as the overhead is minimal. </p>
      <p className="lg:w-11/12 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-lg py-14">The token also provides great benefits to investors in the form of profit sharing from sales on LOF platforms as well as from advertising revenues. These increasing profit shares are also expected to raise the price of the token.
</p>
      <p className="lg:w-11/12 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-lg">For content creators, the token provides an opportunity to maximize profits for selling their content, and while earning LOF, they will also enjoy the same benefits as the investors.</p>
